	<p>I graduated from William Lyon Mackenzie C.I> from the MaCS enrichment program in 2018.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since Fall 2018, I have been attending University of Waterloo in the Bachelors of Mechatronics Engineering.
	</p>
	<p> My interests include mechanical applications using embedded software and microcontrollers like Arduino and Simulink.
	</p>
	<p> However, I also enjoy the software discipline due to its intricate and fast results that reflect my work. Specifically, I enjoy web development that focus on client-end benefits. I also have interests in the ecommerce field of webdev.</p>
