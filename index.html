			<p>
				I have experience in representing my school in the world-wide VEX Robotics competition. This experience has provided me with an opportunity to work through the designing, building, and testing stages of engineering. 
				In addition, the combination of teamwork in a competitive atmoshpere allowed my team to excel in performance.
				The VEX competition has also shown me a glimpse of how many fellow students there are that are as driven and interested in engineering as me.

			<p>
				Using the LEGO Mastermind platform, my robotics team and I participated in the London District's Science Olympics.
				The premesis of the competition was to design a remote-controlled robot that can attack the opponent's balloons attached to their robot.
				My role in the team was to design the defensie mechanism that deflected attacks against our robot's balloons.
				Through rigorous designing sessions and countless hours of building, our team built a robot we were satisfied with.
				In the competition, our robot went through all the rounds undefeated and claimed the first place.

				Studying the Factors that Cause Population Decrease
			</header>
			<small>
				2018-Aug
			</small>
			<p>
				Most countries in the world, especially third-world countries show a growth in population every year. However, Japan's annual population since 2011 has been showing a decreasing rate. 
				By using Python with the Matplotlib library and .txt and csv controls, I have constructed accurate graphic visuals. By comparing the data with the population of U.S.A., I have studied and summarized the causes to Japan's decreasing population.
				This project has allowed me to apply my knowledge in programming to a real-life case that I was interested in learning.
