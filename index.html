						The biggest problem people have at the gym is figuring out what to do there. To eliviate the stress of looking clueless or forgetting the workout regimen, Actollo Fitness takes care of it for the athlete. The website recommends the most optimal training regimen for that day depending on the weather. In addition, all training regimens are stored on Google Firebase.

						Population Analysis
					</h2>
					<small>
						Mar. 2017
					</small>
					<p>
						To understand the pattern in Japan's uniquely decreasing population, I utilized Python along with matplotlib and Pandas. While most of the world's population is quickly increasing every year, Japan is one of the few countries with decreasing population. To resolve this curiosity, I used technology to analyze the data.

						Autonomous Racing Car

						Jan. 2017
					</small>
					<p>
						With the Arduino micrcontroller and ArduinoC, I designed and built an autonomous car. By using LDR (Light Dependent Resistors) as the sensor that keeps the car within the lanes outlined by black markers, the car is able to navigate itself. The operation was given a time constraint of 2 minutes which was satisfied. This project required a combination of software and hands-on hardware skills. Tasks like wiring, soldering, and building from raw materials was common.

						Image Replicator

					<p>
						Our team was given the task to build a robot capable of replicating an image by using a plotting system. With the LEGO MINDSTORM platoform, Tetrix Kit, RobotC, and 3D-printed components, we were able to complete the task. By accepting a Boolean 2D array that stores the outline of the processed image's object, the robot is capable of reproducing images to a 160 x 400-pixel quality.

					<p>
						To compete in the International VEX Robotics Competition, I was given the opportunity to build a robot with a team to fulfill the competition objective. The robot was remotely controllable, and competed in a ring with other teams. My specific role in the team was to build the mechanical components that elevated the robot and the objective pylons.

				I have experience in representing my school in the world-wide VEX Robotics competition. This experience has provided me with an opportunity to work through the designing, building, and testing stages of engineering. 
				In addition, the combination of teamwork in a competitive atmoshpere allowed my team to excel in performance.
				The VEX competition has also shown me a glimpse of how many fellow students there are that are as driven and interested in engineering as me.

			<p>
				Using the LEGO Mastermind platform, my robotics team and I participated in the London District's Science Olympics.
				The premesis of the competition was to design a remote-controlled robot that can attack the opponent's balloons attached to their robot.
				My role in the team was to design the defensie mechanism that deflected attacks against our robot's balloons.
				Through rigorous designing sessions and countless hours of building, our team built a robot we were satisfied with.
				In the competition, our robot went through all the rounds undefeated and claimed the first place.

				Studying the Factors that Cause Population Decrease
			</header>
			<small>
				2018-Aug
			</small>
			<p>
				Most countries in the world, especially third-world countries show a growth in population every year. However, Japan's annual population since 2011 has been showing a decreasing rate. 
				By using Python with the Matplotlib library and .txt and csv controls, I have constructed accurate graphic visuals. By comparing the data with the population of U.S.A., I have studied and summarized the causes to Japan's decreasing population.
				This project has allowed me to apply my knowledge in programming to a real-life case that I was interested in learning.
