					<p>
						The biggest problem people have at the gym is figuring out what to do there. To eliviate the stress of looking clueless or forgetting the workout regimen, Actollo Fitness takes care of it for the athlete. The website recommends the most optimal training regimen for that day depending on the weather. In addition, all training regimens are stored on Google Firebase.

						Tic Tac Toe Game
					</h2>

						Jan. 2018
					</small>
					<p>
						By utilizing embedded software (Arduino) and electrical hardware components such as LDR, my team and I designed and successfully built a line-tracking car. This project required intricate wiring work in systems such as the H-bridge configuration.
						This robot successfully completed the maze following the black line.

						Population Analysis
					</h2>
					<small>
						Mar. 2017
					</small>
					<p>
						To understand the pattern in Japan's uniquely decreasing population, I utilized Python along with matplotlib and Pandas. While most of the world's population is quickly increasing every year, Japan is one of the few countries with decreasing population. To resolve this curiosity, I used technology to analyze the data.

						Autonomous Racing Car
					</h2>
					<small>
						Jan. 2017
					</small>
					<p>
						With the Arduino micrcontroller and ArduinoC, I designed and built an autonomous car. By using LDR (Light Dependent Resistors) as sensors, the car is able to navigate through the maze autonomously. This project required a combination of software and hands-on hardware skills. Tasks like wiring, soldering, and building from raw materials was common.

						Image Replicator
					</h2>
					<small>
						Nov. 2018
					</small>
					<p>
						Our team was given the task to build a robot capable of replicating an image by using a plotting system. With the LEGO MINDSTORM platoform, Tetrix Kit, RobotC, and 3D-printed components, we were able to complete the task. By accepting a Boolean 2D array that stores the outline of the processed image's object, the robot is capable of reproducing images to a 160 x 400-pixel quality.

						VEX Robotics 
					</h2>
					<small>
						Feb. 2017
					</small>
					<p>
						To compete in the International VEX Robotics Competition, I was given the opportunity to build a robot with a team to fulfill the competition objective. The robot was remotely controllable, and competed in a ring with other teams. My specific role in the team was to build the mechanical components that elevated the robot and the objective pylons.
